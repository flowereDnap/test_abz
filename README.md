There are no specific configuration options or customizations required for this project.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following dependencies:
- **Alamofire**: A Swift-based HTTP networking library used for making network requests.
  - Installation: `pod 'Alamofire'`
- **Foundation**: A core framework provided by Apple that provides essential data types, collections, and operating-system services.

## Project Architecture
This project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:
- **Model**: Handles the data logic of the application.
- **View**: Represents the user interface of the app.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the View and the Model, providing data and handling business logic.

Additional components include:
- **Networking Layer**: Built using Alamofire to handle API requests and responses.
- **Data Caching**: Implemented to store images for offline access.

## Troubleshooting
There are currently no known issues. If you encounter any problems, feel free to submit an issue on the repository.
